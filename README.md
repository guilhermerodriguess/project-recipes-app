## Development

The project was developed in a group for 10 days, following established guidelines and requirements. We use the Trello tool to organize and divide tasks among group members, ensuring better collaboration and coordination.

The functionalities were implemented according to the defined screens, with priorities established by the group members. During development, we used TheMealDB and TheCocktailDB APIs to obtain recipe data, following the structure defined by these APIs.

Local storage was used to ensure the persistence of important information such as authentication tokens, made recipes and favorite recipes. We use localStorage to store this data and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Result

The Recipes project was successfully completed, providing an interactive and functional user experience. All the features described have been implemented, allowing users to explore, bookmark, follow up and search for food and drink recipes.

The application has a responsive interface, adapted for mobile devices, providing a pleasant experience on smaller screens. React, Hooks and Context API technologies were used to ensure efficient and scalable development.
